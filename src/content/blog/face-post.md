Prototype: Lets get coding.
===

## Long Hand

Most people that write code for the web has something they start with, and tools they prefer. Here are my choices. For a text editor i like adobe's Brackets for its flexibility, live preview and the fact that there are so many extensions. I write in HTML5, so i have to use a pre-made template for it from a Brackets extension. I also prefer using Compass/SCSS as a preprocessor for its powerful mix-ins, and functions, i start with Normalize.scss from github with only 2 minor changes.  I use Grunt as well when working with code for a live reload when working in php and the fact that i haven't found a powerful enough extension that can handle live reloading of SCSS edits as well as i'd like (there are great one that handle LESS great though.)  Either way going from html to php negates Brackets native live reload anyway.  Finally i use WAMP on my machine so i don't have to be connected to the Internet when i want to preview changes. It's also very convenient when working to change html/css to a WordPress theme. This is my tool set. Everyone's is different, doesn't make them better or worse. I find that this tool set is growing into my abilities as a web designer the more i learn about it.

## prototype ready to review.

OK since I have a prototype on my computer relatively done. I need to preview it on other machines, the easiest way I can think of to do this is to upload it to a web server. But I don't want it to be easy to find, so instead of just dumping it onto my existing WordPress site that just a portfolio, and since i don't need the robustness of a php/mysql server, i decided that a git page could do the trick. And it wouldn't really be a public face of my site. Once i did this i was able to see it on other machines and browsers without much hassle. Including tablets and smart-phones.  from here i can see a few errors that happen between webkit, mozilla, and internet explorer. So time to go back and fix that.
